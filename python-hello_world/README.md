# Python Hello World Project

This repository contains the first Python projects for the Holberton School curriculum.  
It introduces the basics of Python programming, including printing text, using strings, indexing, and slicing.

## Files

- `0-hello.py`: Prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output.
- `1-variable_load.py`: Demonstrates assigning variables and printing them.
- `2-args.py`: Demonstrates using command-line arguments and printing them.
- `8-concat_edges.py`: Concatenates parts of strings to print "object-oriented programming with Python" without using loops or conditionals.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.8.*
- No external libraries are required

## Usage

Make sure each file is executable:

```bash
chmod +x filename.py
Then run the file:

bash
Copy code
./filename.py
Style Guide
All Python files follow Pycodestyle (version 2.7.*) standards.
